# sensAIStudio
This repository contains tools required to train and inference neural networks targetted for Lattice FPGA. The inference tools are available to download from this repository. However, training framework that provides quantization aware training at lower bit precision required to run models on embedded device is not available for download. Please send a request through Lattice sales channel to get access to these tools

sensAIStudio contains sensAICompiler and sensAITools. The sensAICompiler is publicly accessible through Github. User can download the installer and install it on their local Windows or Linux machine. The compiler will enable user to generate runtime to run trained neural networks on Lattice FPGA. The sensAITools enable user to train the model, quantize it during training and analyze/simulate it. This is a private repository that is not accessible directly through Github. Customers are encouraged to contact Lattice sales to get the access.
